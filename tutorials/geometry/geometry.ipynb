    "So far, we discussed quaternions as a 'quality of life improvement', a more convenient formulation for rotations. But their real advantage lies deeper. Quaternions are inherently smooth. Any normalized quaternion (q /norm(q)) is a rotation, and similar quaternions correspond two similar rotations. Try that with rotation matrices: Changing the values by a bit just destroys the rotational properties, as the columns won't be orthonormal anymore. The set of rotation matrices is a complicated submanifold of all matrices. For quaternions, you can just generate a random 4-number vector and normalize it and you get a valid rotation. The resulting rotations will even form a uniform distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This property is foundational for machine learning: During training, we start with random outputs and adjust them locally to improve their quality. Therefore, we need outputs that are somewhat working, even when random, and that respond smoothly to small changes. Alphafold does exactly this to predict the orientations of all individual amino acids: predicting a 4-element vector, then normalizing it.\n",

    "Alphafold creates eight frames to describe the positions of all atoms of the amino acids: Four backbone frames and four side-chain frames. These frames are globalized by interjecting rotation transforms corresponding to the torsion angles. The eight frames are described by their position, the direction of their x-axis and the direction of their y-axis. The x-axis and y-axis are always chosen as two different bonds, which form a tetraeder angle (not orthogonal). Therefore, the y-axis is orthogonalized when constructing the transforms, and only x-axis is fully respected. Note that the concrete bond lengths and tetrahedral angles vary for the different amino acids. Because of that, there aren't eight frames in total, but eight frames per amino acid. We calculate them all individually based on the crystallographic data for the specific amino acids.\n",

Therefore, the backbone-group is the identity transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "- pre-omega-group: The omega-bond isn't used in Alphafold (each amino acid is positioned individually), so this group is empty. We give it the identity transform as value.\n",

The frames are positioned along the main side-chain as defined by `chi_angles_chain` in residue_constants. The side-chain atoms are denoted as #SC0 - #SC3. The frames are the following:\n",

You can see this in `rigid_group_atom_positions`: Look at arginine for example. The frame indices for CA and #SC0 (which is CB here) are 0, and not 4, which is the index of the chi1 transform, the direct parent of chi2.\n",

Therefore, we will just write pos[#SC1] instead of pos[#SC1] - pos[#SC0] for the computation of the x-axes. For the computation of the y-axis, note that they are just the inverse of the x-axis definition: The y-axis of chi2 is along #SC0->CA, and the x-axis of chi1 is #CA->#SC0. Therefore, in local coordinates, the y-axes for chi2, chi3 and chi4 are just (-1, 0, 0).\n",
