    "- Parse the a3m file\n",
    "- Count and remove deletions (residues that are present in the aligned sequences, but aren't present in the query sequence)\n",
    "- Randomly select cluster centers\n",
    "- Randomly change some residues from the cluster center (this is called masking)\n",
    "- Assign non-cluster sequences to their closest cluster center by Hamming Distance\n",
    "- Summarize the features of all sequences assigned to the cluster\n",
    "- Select a fixed number of non-cluster sequences as extra sequences\n",
    "- Assemble the features\n",
