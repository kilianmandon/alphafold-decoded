Tensors of higher order extend this concept into additional dimensions. A colored image for example, is usually represented by a three-dimensional tensor of shape (3, H, W), where H and W are the height and width of  the image in pixels.

We'll use PyTorch to load the classic MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, compute average images for each digit, and build a rudimentary classifier based on these averages. While this classifier is basic, it demonstrates how core tensor operations can be used in a real-world machine learning scenario."

We'll introduce the concept of feature hierarchies, where multiple layers learn to identify increasingly complex patterns. You'll also learn gradient descent – a cornerstone technique for optimizing machine learning models.\n",
