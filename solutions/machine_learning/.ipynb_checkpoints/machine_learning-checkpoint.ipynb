    "(N, d) - Affine - (N, d_hidden) - ReLu - Affine - (N, num_classes) - Sigmoid\n",

    "- Initialize both biases with zeros.\n",
    "- Initialize the weight of the first layer normally distributed with std sqrt(2 / c_in)\n",
    "- Initialize the weight of the second layer normally distributed with std sqrt(2 / (c_in + c_out))\n",

    "The first variant is called He initialization and is mostly used for layers with ReLU activation, the second is called Xavier Normal and is primarly used for sigmoid and tanh activations. This choice of initialization tries to keep the variance of the output similar to the variance of the input. Proper initializations are crucial to avoid gradient explosion or gradient vanishing. This is particularly important for training deeper networks, and the effect can be mitigated by introducing batch normalization or layer normalization.\n",
    "\n",

A feedforward neural network isn't the typical architecture for image classification anyway (even though it worked quite well on these size-normalized, centered images). Architectures that are more typically used are Convolutional Neural Networks and Image Transformers. We won't go into ConvNets in this series, but Image Transformers use the same attention mechanism we will implement in the next chapter as their core building block. "

    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we have seen the basic mechanism of building and training a neural network. This section was kept really short, as we won't have to deal with training ourselves in our AlphaFold implementation. Training a model as big as AlphaFold would be infeasible on personal machines, and renting compute on this scale is really expensive. Also, our code won't be close to being optimized enough to allow for training it (even though theoretically, with torch.autograd, our implementation of the forward pass would allow us to do the full training). \n",
    "\n",
    "Still, there is so much more to discover in machine learning and training neural networks. For example, our training using stochastic gradient descent would typically be replaced by another optimization like Nesterov Momentum or Adam (both have the effect of putting more emphasis on weight changes that are consistent, and that aren't just reverted in the next batch). AlphaFold for example uses Adam for optimization during training. Also, there are many more layers that are really useful. The AlphaFold architecture for example uses dropout (randomly setting a set of values to zero during training, no effect during inference) and LayerNormalization (shifting and scaling the activations of a layer so that they have mean 0 and std 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "We won't implement any more of these here, but there are great resources online. If you still have Machine-Learning energy left after or during this series, check out the CS231n course from Stanford. The assignments from their offering in 2023 are freely available [here](https://github.com/cs231n/cs231n.github.io/tree/master/assignments/2023). You can find lecture slides and videos from previous offerings online. Assignment 1 is basically an improved and more extensive version of this notebook. More recent videos with similar topics were uploaded by Justin Johnson from the University of Michigan [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-TkQAfAZFbzxjBHtzdVCWE0Zbhomg7r&si=fCgVj8DhU1kTidVN). Both are great for getting a deeper introduction to machine learning, specifically Computer Vision.\n",
